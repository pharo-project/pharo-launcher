It will open the image creation window. In Pharo Launcher, images are created using a template. A template is just a zip file with the pharo image and its associated files (sources, changes). Pharo Launcher comes with an official list of templates containing core Pharo images but also other commonly used templates (Pharo MOOC, Moose, etc). First select the template category Templates are sorted by category to improve searchability. The most popular category is Official distributions . It is the default selection. For more information, see the documentation on templates. Select a template. By default, choose the current 64-bit stable Pharo image. Provide image information. You now need to provide a name to your image. If the name is not valid, a red mark will appear just after the name text input. You can optionally provide a description and an initialization script to your image. Click on the Create image button. Important note : the launcher currently does not fit with the \"Save as\" image style - since each launcher image has to be in a new directory. So either use the \"Copy\" image, then \"Launch\" and then only \"Save\" in the target image or copy the \"Saved as\" image in a new folder and refresh the Launcher view on the right side. Which image to choose? In Pharo, an image is the object space containing ALL the objects of the system: objects that are part of the Pharo runtime and development environment AND objects loaded / created by the user. By default, you should use the \"current stable Pharo image\". You should now prefer 64-bit images over 32-bit images. You can use Pharo development image if you want to contribute to Pharo or you can\u2019t wait to discover / use new Pharo features. You can also use any other template coming with preloaded libraries / tools according to your needs. Initially on a new computer the image list is empty. When creating a new image, you can see the image templates that are available on the web (there is also a local cache). Select the template image you want to use and download it. For instance you can download \"Official distributions\" -> \"Pharo 8.0 (stable)\" which is the latest stable image as of today. The launcher will download the image into a specific directory somewhere in your users home directory (you can configure where by clicking the Settings button). Each image gets its own folder. Use the \"Show in folder\" menu item if you want to open this location. Where are stored my images? Launcher files are considered as user documents and so, they are stored in the user document folder, i.e.: $HOME/Documents/Pharo on OS X, $HOME/My Documents/Pharo on windows, $HOME/Pharo on Linux (some Linux distributions provide a document folder but some others not, so we put it in the HOME directory in all cases). In this folder, you will find your images and virtual machines needed to run images. The default location can be customized in Pharo Launcher settings. Image initialization script When working with Pharo, you often need to load your project code and its dependencies. You could also want to execute some actions once to configure your image. This the purpose of the image initialization script: it is a Smalltalk script that will be executed at the first launch of the image and will then be disabled . When creating an image, you can select an already existing script or create a new one. For your conveniance, there is a script editor included in Pharo Launcher.

The default download is a 64-bit version. Windows MacOS GNU/Linux GNU/Linux (32bit) Upgrade notes Upgrading from Pharo Launcher 1.x to Pharo Launcher 2.x Pharo Launcher are mostly compatibles between each other. Pharo Launcher introduces a new serialization format for image metadata. Pharo Launcher 1.x uses different files to store metadata: meta-inf.ston stores the template used to create the image description.txt file contains the description of the image if any pharo.version file tells Pharo Launcher what is the pharo version of the image. Pharo Launcher 2.x uses a single ston file to store all metadata: meta-inf.ston . It stores the origin template, the description and the pahro version as well as other informations like launch configurations (VM to use, VM and image arguments) and initialization script. When using Pharo Launcher 2.x with pre-existing images, meta-data files will be parsed to fetch the metadata and will then be saved in meta-inf.ston with the new format. It means you will not loose information but meta-inf.ston will be overriden, meaning that going back to Pharo Launcher 1.x will throw error when parsing this metadata file. Images and Virtual Machines files are not impacted by the update. You may encouter problems with Pharo Launcher settings parsing. If so, just delete the problematic settings from the settings file. Install on Mac OS X Double-click on the dmg file and drop Pharo Launcher app in Applications folder. Before being able to run Pharo Launcher, you may need to update temporarily your security settings : if you have Mac OS X 10.8 or higher then you might get the following message: This is due to the OS X Gatekeeper feature that is designed to discourage users from downloading apps from random locations and possibly installing something bad. Assuming you've downloaded Pharo Launcher from Pharo web site, then you have nothing to worry about, and you just need to bypass this warning: Recommended - Right click (or command+click) the application icon and select \"open\" Advanced - Enable all application downloads In OS X go to the Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General Unlock the padlock at the bottom of the window, which will require a computer admin password Where it says \"Allow applications downloaded from:\" select \"Anywhere\" OS X will give you a scary warning that is a bit exaggerated. If you're not comfortable with this, use the \"right click\" method mentioned above. In all cases OS X will still ask you if you want to open an \"unsigned\" application the first time it is opened, so new applications that are downloaded can't just start by themselves. Just click on \"Open\". Warning : There is a high probability that the very first run of Pharo Launcher does nothing. In this case, just run it a second time and Pharo Launcher will open. Install on Windows Run the installer and follow instructions. Be sure to install Pharo Launcher in a place where you have write privileges . The installer wil create a shorcut on the Desktop as well as an application entry in the Windows menu. Warning : Antinvirus can prevent Pharo Launcher to behave correctly It has been reported on Windows that the Antivirus prevents Pharo Launcher to download the VMs needed to run images. A workaround is to whitelist PharoLauncher or to temporary disable the antivirus when you need to download new VMs. Install on Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL) Thanks to Christopher Fuhrman, the original author of these instructions . Preparation Install and activate WSL following Microsoft\u2019s instructions . Install an X Server for Windows. You can use VcXsrv : Run XLaunch from the start menu, which invokes a wizard. Accept all the defaults on the wizard. At the last page of the wizard, click Save configuration specifying %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup to have VcXsrv start automatically when you start Windows. You should export DISPLAY=localhost:0 (e.g., in your WSL ~/.bashrc ). Install Mesa with the command sudo apt install mesa-utils . This is apparently needed because there are missing libraries for the X11 display used by Pharo. For reference, if you don\u2019t do this step, you\u2019ll get the following message that\u2019s somewhat misleading: $ ./pharo-ui could not find display driver vm-display-X11; either: - check that /home/myusername/pharo-dir/pharo-vm/lib/pharo/5.0-201901051900//vm-display-X11.so exists, or - use the '-plugins <path>' option to tell me where it is, or - remove DISPLAY from your environment.

The most important one is: Which VM to use? Pharo Launcher can solve this problem for you by using the recommended VM for the Pharo version of the image to launch. Example: For a Pharo 8.0, 64-bit image, Pharo Launcher will use the stable 64-bit virtual machine of Pharo 8. With this information, Pharo Launcher generates a Default launch configuration that will be used to launch the image. You could want to customize this Default configuration or create additional ones, by example, to use another VM (e.g. headless VM), or to give extra arguments to the virtual machine and / or to the image. That's why, if you select the Edit configurations ... entry in the Launch configuration drop list (in the toolbar), Pharo Launcher will open a new window with the Launch configuration editor.

They are materialized by a zip file contining the Pharo image and all its associated file. For example, the Pharo 8 official template is composed of: the sources file: Pharo8.0-32bit-278304f.sources the image: Pharo8.0-SNAPSHOT-64bit-278304f.image the changes file: Pharo8.0-SNAPSHOT-64bit-278304f.changes the pharo version number file (used by Pharo Launcher if present): pharo.version Template categories Official distributions : list of templates officialy supported by Pharo. You will find here latest Pharo images (development, stabl, old stable) and Moose images. Pharo Mooc: convenient category for newcomers to discover Pharo. It contains the MOOC image needed for the practical part of the MOOC. Deprecated distributions: old Pharo and Moose images version (since Pharo 2.0) Pharo Contribution Jenkins: This category represents jobs available on the Jenkins server https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution. If the job provides a zip file as artefact, it will be used as a template to create an image. Moose Jenkins: This category represents jobs available on the Jenkins server https://ci.inria.fr/moose. If the job provides a zip file as artefact, it will be used as a template to create an image. Pharo xx (stable): all versions of the current stable Pharo version Pharo xx (development version): all versions of the current development Pharo version Templates: This category contains templates that are available locally (i.e. without network connection). By default, it only contains the current Pharo stable image that is shipped with Pharo Launcher. Once you start downloading some templates, they are cached in this category for further reuse. Warning: if the template is updated on the server, the cached version will NOT be invalidated, so local and server version of the template will differ. There are different kind of categories: Fixed URL: Represent a list of templates that is defined at construction time. The interesting property of this group is that is does not require the network to be shown. The network is only needed to actually download a template. HTTP listing: Represent a list of templates as given by an HTML webpage. <a href=\"*.zip\"> are searched in the webpage. You can also provide a regular expression to filter files. Jenkins server: group of templates provided by a Jenkins server. I use Jenkins' JSON API to get the data from the server. Cache: special group taking care of caching locally downloaded templates from other template categories. Make my own templates available There are different ways: The easiest way would be to add a CI job on https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/. This job should archive a zip file with your image and the changes file. Then you will be able to browse your image as a template from Pharo contribution Jenkins / / Latest successful build . Another way is to create your own template . Last but not least, you can add your own list of template categories . Create your own template You can create your own templates from Pharo Launcher. From any image in the image list, right-click and select Create template or Create template and delete image . It will create a zip file from the selected image and put it in the Templates category under the provided name. Create your own list of template categories Pharo already provides a wide range of templates but you can provide your own categories. It is useful to add templates that are private (e.g. private jenkins instance) or only of interest for you. It is doable thanks to the mysources.list file located in the PhLUserTemplateSources sourcesFile folder. If present, this file defines additional template sources beyond the official list of templates. At this time, there is no UI to add them but you can take inspiration from the following examples. Here is a Pharo script to generate an example file: | sources | sources := { PhLTemplateSource new type: #HttpListing; name: 'User-defined http listing'; url: 'http://myserver.org/myimages/'. PhLTemplateSource new type: #JenkinsServer; name: 'My Jenkins server'; url: 'https://jenkins.mycompany.org'; username: 'john'; password: 'doefkwoiekfdoekdw2302ek349039e' }. PhLUserTemplateSources sourcesFile writeStreamDo: [ :s | (STON writer on: s) newLine: String lf; prettyPrint: true; nextPut: sources ] You can also edit the file directly if you are comfortable with JSON. Warning: take care to separate each template category by a comma. All categories should be enclosed inside [] . Here is the mysources.list file generated by the above script: [ PhLTemplateSource { #type : #HttpListing, #name : 'User-defined http listing', #url : 'http://myserver.org/myimages/' }, PhLTemplateSource { #type : #JenkinsServer, #name : 'My Jenkins server', #url : 'https://jenkins.mycompany.org', #username : 'john', #password: 'doefkwoiekfdoekdw2302ek349039e' } ] Add a JenkinsServer server You can declare your own Jenkins server by providing its URL and using the #JenkinsServer type. PhLTemplateSource { #type : #JenkinsServer, #name : 'Another Jenkins server', #url : 'https://ci.inria.fr/moose/' } The name will be displayed as the template category. Url will be used to determine Jenkins API to query to get jobs, builds, runs, etc. You can alse declare a private Jenkins server by providing a secure (i.e. using https protocol) URL to access it, a username and its associated token. We advise you to generate an API token and not to use directly your password. See https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/07/02/new-api-token-system/ for more information. The token has to be specified in the password entry. PhLTemplateSource { #type : #JenkinsServer, #name : 'My Jenkins server', #url : 'https://jenkins.mycompany.org', #username : 'john', #password : 'doefkwoiekfdoekdw2302ek349039e' } Add a group from an URL (HTPP listing) An easy way to add a template category is the HTTP listing. You just provide the category name and a URL. Then the category will see all Zip files under this URL as a template available for Pharo Launcher. Here is an example: PhLTemplateSource { #type : #HttpListing, #name : 'Http listing example', #url : 'http://files.pharo.org/pharo-launcher/1.9.2/' } If needed, you can specify a filter pattern to exclude some files to be considered as templates. Here is an example: PhLTemplateSource { #type : #HttpListing, #name : 'Pharo 7.0 (development version)', #url : 'https://files.pharo.org/image/70/', #filterPattern : 'href=\"(Pharo-?7.0.0-(alpha|rc\\\\d+).build.[^\"]*.zip)\"' } filterPattern is given as parameter to RxParser>>#parse: . The filter pattern must have parenthesis because this is what we want to extract for each match. For more information on the regex, see Pharo by example book, regex chapter . There is also an option to specify the format of the template name that will be used into Pharo Launcher. It is usefull when the url has many segments. Here is an example: PhLTemplateSource { #type : #HttpListing, #name : 'Pharo Remote Development (TelePharo)', #url : 'https://github.com/pharo-ide/TelePharo/releases', #filterPattern : 'href=\"([^\"]*/Pharo[0-9][^\"]*.zip)\"', #templateNameFormat: '{6} ({5})' } Numbers {X} between brackets will be replaced with the value of the segment at position X in the URL path segments (ex: '{6} ({5})' with the url segments '/pharo-ide/TelePharo/releases/download/v0.4.2/Pharo7.0-32bit-TelePharo.zip' will give 'Pharo7.0-32bit-TelePharo (v0.4.2)'). Note that the extension of the last segment is automatically dropped. You can also specify a server protected by a login / password as following: PhLTemplateSource { #type : #HttpListing, #name : 'My main images', #url : 'https://intranet.mycompany.org/files', #username : 'john', #password : 'Doe!' } Add a group with individual URL templates It is also possible to create a group that will contain individual URL templates. The group name will be the template category name. Each Template you declare in this group should be of type #URL. A template basically has a name and a URL to the template. You can also specify URLs protected by a password with the #username and #password keywords. PhLTemplateSource { #type : #URLGroup, #name : 'My main images', #templates : [ PhLTemplateSource { #type : #URL, #name : 'MyProject2', #url : 'https://www.mycompany.org/downloads/project2.zip' }, PhLTemplateSource { #type : #URL, #name : 'MyProject1 from private', #url : 'https://intranet.mycompany.org/files/project1.zip', #username : 'john', #password : 'Doe!' } ] }","title":"Templates"},{"location":"templates/#template-categories","text":"Official distributions : list of templates officialy supported by Pharo.
