The most important one is: Which VM to use? Pharo Launcher can solve this problem for you by using the recommanded VM for the Pharo version of the image to launch. Example: For a Pharo 8.0, 64-bit image, Pharo Launcher will use the stable 64-bit virtual machine of Pharo 8. With this insformation, Pharo Launcher generates a Default launch configuration that will be used to launch the image. You could want to customize this Default configuration or create additional ones, by example, to use another VM (e.g. headless VM), or to give extra arguments to the virtual machine and / or to the image. That's why, if you select the Edit configurations ... entry in the Launch configuration drop list (in the toolbar), Pharo Launcher will open a new window with the Launch configuration editor. From this editor, you can: add/remove Launch configuration for the selected Pharo image, choose another VM than the one Pharo Launcher selected for you, add/remove arguments to the Virtual Machine, add/remove arguments to the image.

It will create a zip file from the selected image and put it in the Templates category under the provided name. Create your own list of template categories Pharo already provides a wide range of templates but you can provide your own categories. It is useful to add templates that are private (e.g. private jenkins instance) or only of interest for you. It is doable thanks to the mysources.list file located in the Pharo folder. If present, this file defines additional template sources to the official list of templates. At this time, there is no UI to add them but you can take inspiration from the following examples. Warning: take care to separate each template category by a comma. All categories should be enclosed inside [] . Here is an example of a mysources.list file: [ PhLTemplateSource { #type : #HttpListing, #name : 'User-defined http listing', #url : 'http://myserver.org/myimages/' }, PhLTemplateSource { #type : #JenkinsServer, #name : 'My Jenkins server', #url : 'https://jenkins.mycompany.org', #username : 'john', #password: 'doefkwoiekfdoekdw2302ek349039e' } ] Add a Jenkin server You can declare your own Jenkins server by providing its URL and using the #JenkinsServer type.

Url will be used to determine Jenkins API to query to get jobs, builds, runs, etc. You can alse declare a private Jenkins server by providing a secure (i.e. using https protocol) URL to access it, a username and its associated token. We advise you to generate an API token and not to use directly your password. See https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/07/02/new-api-token-system/ for more information. The token has to be specified in the password entry.
