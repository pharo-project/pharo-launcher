I'm an object that can create new identical images. I have a name to distinguish myself from other templates. I also have a list of categories that make sense for the images I create.

An example of me could be a 'Seaside3.1' template. In this case my name would be 'Seaside3.1' and my categories could be #('Web' 'Experimental'

Instance Variables
	categories:		<Object>
	name:		<Object>

categories
