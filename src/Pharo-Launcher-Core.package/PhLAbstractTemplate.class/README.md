I'm an object that can create new identical images. I have a name to distinguish myself from other templates. I also have a list of categories that make sense for the images I create.

An example of me could be a 'Seaside3.1' template. In this case my name would be 'Seaside3.1' and my categories could be #('Web' 'Experimental').

Currently, all templates are represented by a zip file somewhere locally or on the network.
