I represent a group of templates.

The #templateAndGroups method is very important. Calling this method must answer a collection of my subgroups and of templates that I directly contain.

Most of my subclasses won't have to do any caching, even the network-intensive ones. This is because PhLCacheTemplateGroup does that for everyone.
