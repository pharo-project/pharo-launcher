I'm a group of images which are stored in subdirectories of a dedicated directory.

Each image in the group is stored in its own subdirectory with the same name as the image. E.g., if the group's baseDirectory is ~/.config/pharo/images, one example of an image could be ~/.config/pharo/images/Seaside3.0/Seaside3.0.image.

Instance Variables
	baseDirectory:		place where the images are stored
	images:		collection of PhImage
