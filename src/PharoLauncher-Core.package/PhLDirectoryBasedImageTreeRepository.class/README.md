I'm a group of images and/or image tree

I add to PhLDirectoryBasedImageRepository the possibility of organising images in a hierarchy of  directories (with a special name extension)

These directories have a special name (see #treeNodeDirectoryExtension) to make it easier to diferentiate them from directories containing images
